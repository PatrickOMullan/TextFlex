# TextFlex

This project is written in python using the Django framework. In order to run it you will need the following installed:

-Anaconda

-pip

-django
python -m pip install Django

-crispyforms
pip install django-crispy-forms

To start the server run the following command when in the TextFlex folder:

-python manage.py runserver

If for whatever reason, you run into issues getting the Django server up and running please contact me! I got this working on a VM so I can probably figure out what went wrong.

Other Notes: I initially had a recover password system in place, but it required personal email information which I had to remove when I made the repo public, as a result that no longer functions.
