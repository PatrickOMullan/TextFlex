# TextFlex

This project is written in python using the Django framework. In order to run it you will need the following installed:

-Anaconda

-------------------------------
-pip

-------------------------------
-django

python -m pip install Django

-------------------------------
-crispyforms

pip install django-crispy-forms

-------------------------------
To start the server run the following command when in the TextFlex folder:

-python manage.py runserver

If for whatever reason, you run into issues getting the Django server up and running please contact me! I got this working on a VM so I can probably figure out what went wrong.

Other Notes: I initially had a recover password system in place, but it required personal email information which I had to remove when I made the repo public, as a result that no longer functions.

I also need to give credit to GitHub user Krconv for their work on a bannerweb scraping system. I was able to modify their system to pulls schedules instead of register for classes. Their framework was very organized and I used their methodology to scrape the barnes and noble store also!
